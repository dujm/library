    "# About\n",
    " * This notebook uses **LLM agents** to mimic a debate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) LLM Agents\n",
    "   * **Moderator** Agent: who introduces the topic.\n",
    "   * **Affirmative and Opposing Agents**: who take part in the debate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### b) Debate\n",
    "   * The moderator introduces the debate topic (e.g., `The impact of a region's culture on sports`).\n",
    "   * In each debate round, the Opposing Agent starts. Then the Affirmative Agent follows.\n",
    "   * In total, there are three rounds of debate.\n",
    "   * The debate agents use information from `wikipedia` to support theim claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) Technical background\n",
    " * **Cohere's `command-r` LLM model** is selected. \n",
    " * **[Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/providers/cohere/)**, a framework to build LLM-powered applications, is used to create agents.\n",
    " * Most of the code is from [Two Agent Debates with Tools](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/cookbook/two_agent_debate_tools.ipynb). Adjustments are made to model, agent, and output.\n",

      "(Opposing - Round 1): While it's true that culture is often attributed to a specific location, this doesn't mean that sports are defined by where they're played. Sports are a universal language, understood across different societies and locations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Take the example of football. YSCC Yokohama is a Japanese sports club, most famous for its football team. Football is clearly a global sport, transcending the boundaries of culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(Affirmative  - Round 1): While I appreciate your perspective, I must disagree. Culture has a profound impact on the sports landscape, influencing the rules, styles and very essence of the games we play. Take India as an example. India has a rich tapestry of traditional sports, some dating back thousands of years. These sports are deeply rooted in the country's cultural history, varying across different regions, and often requiring little equipment or space to play. The British Raj saw a decline in the popularity of these traditional games, but they remain an integral part of India's cultural identity. \n",
      "\n",
      "Culture impacts sports in numerous other ways too. Sports are often governed by customs and values that ensure fair competition and adherence to specific styles or rules. Think of the Olympic Games, which only admit sports that fulfil their physical definition. Yet, culture also acknowledges the mental aspect of competition, with the International Olympic Committee recognising chess and bridge as bona fide sports. These 'mind sports' are a testament to the varied influences that culture has on the sports we enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(Opposing - Round 2): While the Affirmative focuses on the impact of culture on the rules and styles of sports, it's important to remember that sports are first and foremost physical activities. As such, the most significant influence on the way sports are played is the physical abilities and skills of the participants. Culture may impact the essence of a sport, but the essence of sport itself is physicality. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the very definition of a sport is based on physical athleticism or physical dexterity, as per major competitions like the Olympic Games. While culture does acknowledge the mental aspect of competition—with the International Olympic Committee recognising chess and bridge as sports—these are the exception rather than the rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(Affirmative  - Round 2): Culture influences sports in numerous ways, including the rules and styles of the games themselves. However, it's also important to acknowledge that sports are physical activities, and the most significant influence on their execution will always be the physical abilities of the participants. \n",
      "\n",
      "While I agree that culture plays a massive role in shaping the sports landscape, we must also appreciate the central role of physicality in defining sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(Opposing - Round 3): The physical attributes of sports participants are indeed a significant element of sports. Athletes competing in sports that demand physical strength, speed, power or endurance require these physical abilities to perform at the highest levels. The very definition of an athlete centres on physical prowess, and the word is often used to refer to those engaged in athletics, highlighting the importance of physicality. \n",
      "\n",
      "While culture may influence the rules and essence of a sport, the physical capabilities of athletes remain paramount, defining the very nature of sports and how they are played.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(Affirmative  - Round 3): Culture influences sports in numerous ways, including the very definition of a sport. While the physical abilities of athletes are indeed paramount, the fact remains that culture shapes the parameters within which these physical activities take place. \n",
      "\n",
      "The influence of culture on sports is evident in the existence of numerous traditional sports around the world, often requiring little equipment or space. Culture also acknowledges the mental aspect of competition, with several organisations recognising chess and bridge as bona fide sports. Moreover, culture defines the rules and customs that govern sports, ensuring fair competition. \n",
